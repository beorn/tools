# bearly

Monorepo of reusable Claude Code tools. Each package is **independently publishable** with its own version, README, CHANGELOG, and npm scope.

The root `bearly` package is `private: true` at version `0.0.0` — it is never published. Only the child packages are published.

## Packages

### The tribe family (one cohesive product)

See the [domain model in `plugins/tribe/README.md`](plugins/tribe/README.md#domain-model) for the authoritative vocabulary (tribe, member, chief, agent, daemon, wire, lore, recall).

| Package         | npm                                                | Role                                                                                                        | Entry Point      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `@bearly/tribe` | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bearly/tribe) | Coordination + memory daemon + MCP tools + `tribe` CLI — wire, lore, plugins, watch TUI, all in one package | `plugins/tribe/` |

`@bearly/lore` was folded into `@bearly/tribe` on 2026-04-17 — what was the standalone memory daemon (focus cache, LLM summarizer, per-session hook dedup) now ships inside tribe. The split existed briefly while the concepts stabilized; the unified package is the steady state.

**0.10.0 — purge complete (2026-04-17)** — MCP tools live exclusively under the `tribe.*` namespace, env vars exclusively under `TRIBE_*`. All legacy `lore.*` / `tribe_*` / `LORE_*` names introduced for the 0.9.0 deprecation window have been removed — both tools/list emission and dispatch reject them. Daemon wire-protocol version 4. See `plugins/tribe/CHANGELOG.md` for the full purge scope.

**Matrix-shape rooms (km-tribe.matrix-shape)** — schema migration v10 added `rooms` and `room_members` tables modelled on the Matrix protocol's room shape. **Single-default-room semantics today**: every project has one room (`room:<project_id>` or `room:default` for unscoped sessions), every connected session is a member, every message is implicitly in it. `tribe.members` JOINs `room_members` to source its session list, and a startup invariant (`backfillDefaultRoomMembers` in `with-runtime.ts`) guarantees every session row has its membership row. Sub-rooms (multi-room within a daemon) and federated rooms (cross-machine bridging) are tracked separately under the same bead — not in scope today.

### Supporting primitives

| Package          | npm               | Role                                                                                                    | Entry Point       |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `@bearly/recall` | _private (0.1.0)_ | Session-history search primitive — FTS5 + LLM planner/agent. Used by tribe internally; also standalone. | `plugins/recall/` |
| `@bearly/llm`    | _private (0.1.0)_ | Multi-provider LLM dispatch — cheap-model race, consensus, deep research                                | `plugins/llm/`    |

Future packages (not yet extracted): `@bearly/refactor`, `@bearly/tty`, `@bearly/worktree`.

### Package Independence Rules

Each package in `plugins/` must:

- Have its own `package.json` with version, name, description
- Have its own `README.md` describing usage independently of bearly
- Have its own `CHANGELOG.md` tracking releases
- Be publishable to npm independently (`npm publish` from its directory)
- Not depend on the root bearly package or other bearly packages (unless via npm)
- Work when installed via `npm install @bearly/<package>` without the monorepo

## Tools (not yet packaged)

These live in `tools/` and run from source. They will eventually become independent packages.

| Tool             | Description                                                 | Entry Point                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `refactor`       | Batch rename, replace, API migration                        | `bun tools/refactor.ts`       |
| `llm`            | Multi-LLM research, consensus, deep research                | `bun tools/llm.ts`            |
| `recall`         | Session history search, LLM synthesis                       | `bun tools/recall.ts`         |
| ~~`tty`~~        | ~~TTY testing MCP server~~ — **folded into `termless mcp`** (see note below) | `termless mcp` (via `@termless/cli`) |
| `worktree`       | Git worktree management with submodules — **now lives in km/tools/worktree.ts** (see note below) | `bun tools/worktree.ts` (km root) |
| `github-channel` | GitHub notifications (deprecated — use tribe github plugin) | `bun tools/github-channel.ts` |

### Note: `tty` moved out of vendor/bearly

Per [`@km/infra/mcp-tty-ghostty-backend-toggle`](https://github.com/beorn/km/blob/main/%40km/infra/mcp-tty-ghostty-backend-toggle.md): the canonical `tty` MCP tool lives in `@termless/cli` (run as `termless mcp`), not in this submodule. The deprecated `bun tools/tty.ts` + `tools/lib/playwright-tty/` were deleted in Phase 9 (2026-05-19). The migration was driven by the native canvas pipeline (`@napi-rs/canvas` + `ghostty-web` in pure Bun) that eliminated termless's Chromium dependency, making bearly's Playwright-based tty wrapper redundant — `termless mcp`'s `screenshot` tool routes through `Terminal.screenshot()` for the same (or better) fidelity, with no Chromium and a resvg cross-platform fallback. Existing MCP client configs that pointed at the bearly `playwright-tty` MCP server should switch to `termless mcp`.

### Note: `worktree` moved out of vendor/bearly

Per [`@km/all/worktree-tooling-submodule-cycle`](https://github.com/beorn/km/blob/main/%40km/all/worktree-tooling-submodule-cycle.md): the canonical `bun worktree` tool now lives at `km/tools/worktree.ts`, not in this submodule. This breaks the submodule-pointer-propagation cycle where main bumps the bearly pointer for a worktree-tooling fix but each git-worktree carries its own pinned pointer that doesn't auto-update. `vendor/bearly` retains the source for backwards-compatible callers but the km root is the source of truth.

### Tribe Tools (part of @bearly/tribe)

| Tool            | Description                                             | Entry Point                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `tribe-daemon`  | Coordination daemon (discovery broker, Unix socket IPC) | `bun tools/tribe-daemon.ts`  |
| `stdio-adapter` | Per-agent stdio↔Unix-socket MCP transport adapter       | `bun tools/stdio-adapter.ts` |
| `tribe-cli`     | CLI: status, send, log, health, sessions, retro, watch  | `bun tools/tribe-cli.ts`     |
| `tribe-watch`   | Live TUI dashboard (React/Silvery)                      | `bun tools/tribe-watch.tsx`  |

### Plugin System

Tribe supports plugins for optional capabilities. Plugins gracefully degrade.

| Plugin      | Activates when                | What it does                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git`       | Inside a git repo             | Broadcasts new commits to all sessions                           |
| `beads`     | `.beads/` dir exists          | Broadcasts bead claims/closures                                  |
| `github`    | `gh auth` available           | Monitors all user repos, broadcasts push/PR/CI/issue events      |
| `health`    | Always                        | CPU, memory, disk, fd, git-lock, GitHub rate limit, I/O monitors |
| `accountly` | `~/.config/accountly/` exists | Auto-rotates Claude Max accounts at quota thresholds             |

## Skills

See `skills/` for Claude Code skill definitions:

- `batch-refactor/` — Batch refactoring workflow
- `llm/` — Multi-LLM queries
- ~~`tty/`~~ — Terminal app testing (folded into `termless mcp`; see Tools table note above)
- `tribe/` — Tribe coordination

## Development

```bash
cd vendor/bearly
bun install
bun run typecheck
```

## Releasing

Only publish child packages, never the root. The root `bearly` package stays at `0.0.0` permanently.

Publishing is CI-driven via per-package tags. `.github/workflows/release.yml` fires on tags matching `<package-dir-name>-v<version>` and publishes only the matching package.

```bash
# Bump version in packages/<pkg>/package.json, then:
git commit -am "release: alien-trees 0.2.0"
git tag alien-trees-v0.2.0
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

The workflow parses the tag, verifies `package.json` version matches (fails fast on drift), builds with tsc, and runs `npm publish --access public --provenance`.

**Local fallback** for emergencies:

```bash
cd packages/<pkg> && bun run build && npm publish --access public --provenance
```

Required GitHub secret: `NPM_TOKEN`. Provenance runs via OIDC (no extra setup).
