# Think Big — What If This Problem Didn't Need to Exist?

**Keywords**: big, think big, reframe, hypotheses, architecture

**This is a meta-protocol, not an LLM tool.** It calls `/pro` or `/deep` internally during Phase 3 — its value is the structured 10-20-hypothesis reframing workflow, not the model call.

**STOP fixing. START reframing.**

You're here because either: (a) the user asked you to think bigger, (b) you're about to write a patch that feels wrong, or (c) the same class of bug keeps appearing. The goal is not to solve the problem in front of you — it's to find the design where this problem **can't happen**.

## The Problem

$ARGUMENTS

**If no arguments**: Infer from recent conversation — what bugs keep appearing? What area feels fragile? What did the user just report? Don't ask "what should I think about?"

## Phase 1: See the Problem Five Ways

Before generating solutions, understand the problem from 5 different angles. Write 1-2 sentences for each:

1. **The user's words** — What did they literally say/see? (not your interpretation)
2. **The system's perspective** — What state transition or invariant was violated?
3. **The architectural view** — Which layer boundary was crossed, leaked, or missing?
4. **The historical view** — `bun recall "keywords"` — has this class of problem appeared before? How many times? What was tried?
5. **The counterfactual** — In a perfectly designed system, why would this problem be impossible?

The counterfactual (#5) is the most important. It points toward the real fix.

## Phase 2: Generate Hypotheses (Round 1)

Generate **10-20 hypotheses** — not solutions, but *framings*. Each hypothesis proposes a different root cause or a different way to eliminate the problem entirely.

Categories to force breadth:

| Category | Question | Example hypothesis |
|---|---|---|
| **Missing abstraction** | What concept should exist but doesn't? | "There should be a CursorScope that guarantees valid cursor at all times" |
| **Wrong ownership** | Who owns this state? Should someone else? | "The view owns cursor state but the model should — then undo gets it free" |
| **Missing invariant** | What rule is enforced by convention but should be enforced by code? | "Node parent_id validity is checked at render time but should be checked at mutation time" |
| **Unnecessary complexity** | What if this entire subsystem didn't exist? | "If cards auto-expanded during edit, the expand-on-edit bug can't exist" |
| **Wrong layer** | Is this logic in the right place? | "This is a view concern solved in the model — move it to the view" |
| **Prior art** | How do VS Code / Obsidian / Notion / Asana handle this? | "Notion doesn't have this problem because editing is always inline, never modal" |
| **Inverse** | What if we did the opposite of what we're doing? | "Instead of detecting edit mode and special-casing, make edit mode the default" |
| **Composition** | Can two simpler things replace one complex thing? | "Split the monolithic action handler into keyboard-layer + mutation-layer" |
| **Deletion** | What if we deleted this code entirely? | "The [error] fallback exists because we handle missing nodes — what if we didn't allow missing nodes?" |
| **Unification** | Are there 2-3 similar mechanisms that should be one? | "Card edit, sub-item edit, and title edit are 3 code paths — should be 1" |

**Write all hypotheses as a numbered list before exploring any of them.** Breadth first, depth second.

## Phase 3: Explore (Round 1)

For each hypothesis, spend 2-5 minutes:
1. **Grep/read** the relevant code to check feasibility
2. **Estimate blast radius** — how many files change? Is it additive or rewrite?
3. **Score**: Does this solve just the immediate problem, or a whole class of problems?

Mark each: `NARROW` (fixes this bug only), `BROAD` (fixes a class), `REFRAME` (makes the problem impossible).

### Ask an External LLM (REQUIRED)

Your own hypotheses have blind spots. **Always consult at least one external perspective** during exploration. Pick the right tool:

| Tool | Best for | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **`/pro "question"`** | "Is this design sound? What am I missing?" — 3-leg + judge with code context | ~$0.20 |
| **`/ask "question"`** | Quick prior art — "how does VS Code handle X?" — single model | ~$0.02 |
| **`/llm --deep`** | Research with web search + citations | ~$2-5 |
| **`/csw`** | Compare 4+ approaches with decision matrix | Free (internal) |
| **`bun recall "keywords"`** | Check if prior sessions already explored this | Free |

**How to ask well** (from `/fresh`):
- Lead with **symptoms**, not diagnosis — let the LLM form its own model
- Include **full source files**, not snippets — the LLM needs to see how functions interact
- Ask **open discovery questions** ("What mechanism could cause X?"), not confirmation questions ("Is my fix correct?")
- State **failed approaches last** — constrain the solution space without anchoring

Build a context file with the relevant code, then:
```bash
bun llm --deep -y --no-recover --context-file /tmp/big-context.md "What design would make [problem] impossible?"
```

## Phase 4: Synthesize (Round 1)

Write a 3-5 sentence synthesis:
- Which hypotheses were `REFRAME` or `BROAD`?
- What patterns do they share?
- What new questions emerged?
- What didn't you consider in Phase 2 that's now obvious?

## Phases 5-6: Iterate (Rounds 2-5)

**Repeat the generate→explore→synthesize cycle.** Each round builds on the previous:

- **Round 2**: Combinations of Round 1 ideas + deeper exploration of REFRAME scores
- **Round 3+**: Only if the synthesis raises new questions or the REFRAME ideas aren't converging yet

**Stop iterating when**: the synthesis stops producing new insights, or you have a clear REFRAME with high confidence. Most problems need 2-3 rounds. Complex architectural questions may need 4-5.

**Each round**: Generate **5-20 hypotheses** (scale with problem complexity — a simple guard bug needs 5, an architectural reframe needs 15-20). Explore each. Synthesize.

## Phase 7: Final Synthesis

### Quality levels (preferred over "plateau distance %")

When framing how far the current state is from a real fix, **use the L0-L5 rubric, not percentages**. Percentages drift to vibe ("this is 65% to plateau"); the rubric is verifiable per-bead.

- **L0** — workaround / threshold / env tweak
- **L1** — runtime guard catches it
- **L2** — invariant asserted + debug diagnostics
- **L3** — API/lifecycle structure makes invalid state hard
- **L4** — architecture makes invalid state impossible by construction
- **L5** — old workaround code deleted + property/fuzz tests cover regression

Full definitions, examples, and anti-patterns: [hub/quality-rubric.md](../../../hub/quality-rubric.md).

State both the **current level** and the **target level** in the recommendation. "Current L1 → target L4" frames the work honestly; "65% → 90%" doesn't.

Write the recommendation:

```markdown
### Reframing: [problem]

**The real problem is**: [1 sentence — what's actually wrong at the design level]

**Current level → target level**: Lx → Ly (see [hub/quality-rubric.md](../../../hub/quality-rubric.md))

**The solution that makes it unnecessary**: [1-3 sentences — the design change that moves the bead from Lx to Ly]

**What it solves beyond the immediate bug**: [list of related problems this also fixes]

**Effort**: [rough scope — files, risk, phases]

**First step**: [the smallest move toward this design]
```

## Phase 8: Action Plan

Convert findings into concrete actions. Classify each by confidence:

### DO (obvious, low-risk — execute immediately)
- Ship the narrow fix for the immediate bug
- Create issues for reframes with a great first paragraph capturing the analysis: 1-3 sentences (50-400 chars) saying WHAT this issue is + WHY it matters — that's what an issue tracker's quick-list view surfaces. Make it scannable cold; full reframe detail (hypothesis exploration, alternatives considered) goes in body sections after the lead paragraph.
- Delete dead code identified during exploration
- Add missing invariants that are clearly correct

### ASK (significant, needs user approval — present and wait)
- Architectural changes touching 3+ packages
- Reframes that change public API or user-visible behavior
- Changes that conflict with existing beads or in-progress work
- Anything where the "right" answer depends on product direction

Present each ASK item with: what, why, effort, and what you'd recommend.

### Format

```markdown
## Actions

### Doing now:
1. Fix [immediate bug] — [1 sentence]
2. Create bead km-<scope>.<reframe> — [title] (P3, design captured)
3. [any other obvious actions]

### Need your call:
1. **[Change X]** — [why it's better]. Effort: [scope]. Recommend: [yes/no/defer].
2. **[Change Y]** — [why]. Effort: [scope]. Recommend: [yes/no/defer].
```

**Execute the DO items. Ask about the ASK items. Don't stall on asking — ship what's obvious.**

## /big vs /fresh

Both involve stepping back from implementation. The difference:

| | `/big` | `/fresh` |
|---|---|---|
| **Trigger** | Proactive — before coding, when the fix feels wrong | Reactive — after 20+ min stuck, going in circles |
| **Core activity** | Generate 10-20 hypotheses, 2 rounds, score NARROW/BROAD/REFRAME | Gather context (full files), structure question, ask external LLM |
| **External LLM** | Required (Phase 3) | Required (Phase 4) |
| **Output** | Action plan with DO/ASK items | LLM response + concrete plan |
| **Best at** | Finding the design where the problem can't happen | Getting unstuck on a specific implementation problem |

**Use `/big` when the problem is the design. Use `/fresh` when the problem is you're stuck.** `/big` subsumes `/fresh` — if you're running `/big`, you don't also need `/fresh`.

## When to Use This

- The fix you're about to write feels like duct tape
- The same area has had 3+ bugs in the last month
- You're adding a special case to handle an edge case of a special case
- The user says "this keeps happening" or "why does this keep breaking"
- You've been debugging for 20+ minutes and the root cause keeps shifting

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Why |
|---|---|
| Jump to the first good hypothesis | You'll miss the reframe — explore all 10-20 |
| Only generate "fix" hypotheses | Include deletion, inversion, and unification |
| Skip the synthesis between rounds | Round 2 hypotheses should build on Round 1 learnings |
| Propose a massive rewrite without a narrow fix | Ship the narrow fix, bead the reframe |
| Think big without checking code | Hypotheses must be grounded — grep and read |
| Stop at Round 1 | The best ideas come from Round 2, after you've learned what doesn't work |

## Wave-loop fan-out (canonical: /bead-pickup JIT BCC)

The 10-20 hypotheses /big generates are independent → fan out validation via `Explore` sub-agents in ONE message. Each hypothesis = one sub-agent:

- Prompt: "Hypothesis: <H>. Validate against codebase by grepping <paths> + reading <files>. 150 words: evidence-for, evidence-against, confidence (0-1), 1-3 follow-up questions."
- Return: signal vs. noise on each hypothesis surfaces fast; high-confidence-low-evidence ones survive to wave 2

After wave 1: integrate into hypothesis ranking; harvest follow-ups for any surviving high-leverage branches; wave 2 drills into "where does invariant X actually live?" for the top 2-3.

This turns /big's serial hypothesis-eval into parallel. Canonical: `.claude/skills/bead-pickup/SKILL.md` § "JIT bead-context-completion".

## Pairs with

- [/undead](../undead/SKILL.md) — when a bead reopens (n≥2 #undead recurrence), the bead's REPEATED failure is itself evidence. Load /undead for the 20-mode failure-hypothesis sweep tuned to recurrence patterns + Gate 0 scope-escalation. /big's 10 reframe categories apply on top.
- [/why](../why/SKILL.md) — 5-Whys causal-chain analysis. Complementary, not redundant: /big generates breadth (10-20 hypotheses); /why drills depth (1 chain, 5 levels). Use /big when the fix feels wrong; /why when you've identified ONE candidate and want to trace it to its architectural root.
- [/trouble](../trouble/SKILL.md) — regression-specific live-repro discipline (used to work / stopped working). /trouble produces the evidence /big reframes on.
