 *   - `event`     — journal-only row, never delivered to any client
 *                   (recipient = '*' but delivery filter checks `kind` first)
 *
 * Classification (actionable vs ambient) lives on the separate `delivery`
 * column — see `Delivery` below. The two axes are independent: a broadcast
 * can be `push` (actionable bell) or `pull` (ambient inbox-only), and a
 * direct message is always `push`.

/**
 * Insert a message row and (optionally) fan out to connected sockets.
 *
 * The daemon wires its fan-out hook through `ctx.onMessageInserted` so that
 * handlers in this file don't need to know about sockets. Standalone callers
 * (tests, migrations) don't set the hook — the row still lands in SQLite,
 * which is the durability baseline.
 *
 * `rowid` is returned so the daemon can advance per-recipient
 * `sessions.last_delivered_seq` after a successful write().
 *
 * `kind` defaults to `direct` for backward compatibility. Broadcasts should
 * pass `broadcast`; journal-only events should pass `event` (and route via
 * `logEvent` which sets the type prefix).
