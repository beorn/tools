/**
 * Tribe daemon boot — `pipe + with*` composition entry point.
 *
 * This is the structural skeleton that builds the daemon value top-down.
 * It uses the factory layer in `tools/lib/tribe/compose/` to assemble
 * everything that's cleanly decomposable (config, db, ctx, recall, tools,
 * pluginApi, plugins) and exposes seams for the still-imperative parts
 * of `tribe-daemon.ts` (socket server, JSON-RPC dispatcher, hot-reload,
 * idle-quit) to attach to.
 *
 * The reading order matches the architecture topology in
 * `hub/architecture.md` § "Tribe — the runtime topology":
 *
 *   project root
 *   └── tribe-daemon
 *       ├── config + db (filesystem boundary)
 *       ├── daemon ctx + recall handlers (in-process state)
 *       ├── tool registry — populated before surfaces
 *       │   ├── messaging tools (tribe.send / broadcast / members / …)
 *       │   └── recall tools (tribe.ask / brief / plan / …)
 *       ├── observer plugins (git, beads, github, health, accountly, dolt-reaper)
 *       └── runtime (socket server, dispatcher, hot-reload, idle quit, signals)
 *
 * Today the boot in `tribe-daemon.ts` runs as imperative module-level code.
 * This file shows the target shape; cutover to it as the entry point lands
 * in a follow-on bead (see `km-tribe.composition-pipe-boot-cutover`) once
 * the still-coupled imperative state (clients map, chiefClaim, broadcast
 * pipeline) has been refactored into withX factories of its own.
 *
 * The prototype is here so the pipe shape is reviewable as code, not just
 * design doc — and so callers building alternative daemon entry points
 * (test fixtures, embedded usage) can compose from the same primitives.
